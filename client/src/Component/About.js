      Temper proof docuemnt issuance is a website that  help a wider community into using secure and verifiable tamper 
      proof document issuing and verification. In this idea, the verifier (institution) needs to Trust on the Institution that is issuing the document. The document is stored on the wallet, but the best part is, the product supports cross-wallet platform. Which means the product or website does not depend on a specific wallet. Since, blockchain is immutable, we cannot alter the documents once stored and issued by the institute.
